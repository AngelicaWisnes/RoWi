- Regex for uppercase variables: \$[A-Z]{2,}            OR       \$(?!PSScriptRoot)([A-Z]{2,})      OR     \$(?!(PSScriptRoot|MY_POWERSHELL|MY_BROWSER|MY_DOTNET_IDE|DEFAULT_START_PATH|PROFILE|FIFTY_CHARS))([A-Z]{2,})
  Make sure that the only variables that are all uppercase, are the ones that are used in AND outside of the defining file (global in some way)


Create alias for all funtions, and change the corresponding function-name to something clear and selfexplainatory

Prepend all "uncallable"/util-function-names with something like "util"
